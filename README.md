Hi, in this project I used PYTHON 3.9.5 and build a mini type racer program where one can type 'computer' word and can check his/her speed and efficiency of typing successively the word for an amount of 5 times graphically, for which, I used PYHTON'S MATPLOTLIB library and to be more I used PYPLOT module of MATPLOTLIB library. For calculating time I imported TIME module of PYTHON. 


The code is alright, be sure to use and check your typing efficiency.
HAPPY LEARNING!!
